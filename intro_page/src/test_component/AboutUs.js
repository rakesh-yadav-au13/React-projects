                <p id="aboutp">Hi, my name is Abhishek Ranjan , and I was born the 21th of May, 1994. I'm from INDIA. I have graduated from the IEC University. The course I took was Information Technology. Since March 2016 I have enthusiastically been studying programming.Now I am a Student of AttainU in Aryabhata Batch for learn coding and not only in AttainU, but also via Internet. I think I have tried every possible way of learning, as in, watching many hours of video tutorials, learning through websites like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and many others, and also learning through the mobile app Sololearn. I also finished two courses, eSova (JavaScript) and Clever (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript), coming in at number one in Šabac. The last couple of months I've mostly been reading e-books about programming. As a result, I now have enough knowledge to make programs using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, T-SQL, ASP.NET MVC, Git. I'm currently looking to get a job as a junior programmer using the skills I already possess. I'm a workaholic and I see myself as a future programmer. I love creating stuff with code, it's like having superpowers in real life, and yes, in my younger years I read many comics.</p>
